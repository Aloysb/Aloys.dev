#Aloys.dev

A simple pure HTML/CSS/JS website to display my projects
Built on purpose without any framework or library.

I believe that a good developper needs solid fundations, which is why went for pure vanilla CSS & JS.

Responsive, clever use of flexbox and grid abilities. With a touch of CSS plain animations.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoy building it!

Feel free to get in touch with me for a chat.
