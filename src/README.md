#Aloys.dev

A simple pure HTML/CSS/JS website to display my projects
Built on purpose without any framework or library.

I believe that a good developper needs solid fundations, which is why went for pure vanilla CSS & JS.

Responsive, clever use of flexbox and grid abilities. With a touch of CSS plain animations.

The website is bundled and built for production using Parcel and served with Nginx + Node + ExpressJS.
The contact form is handled with Nodemailer package.
The UI design is made by myself, using Adobe XD.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoy building it!

Feel free to get in touch with me for a chat.
